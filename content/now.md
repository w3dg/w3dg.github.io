## 9th Feb, 2025

It's been almost a month into my first gig. I am surrounded by people in tech, constantly learning about the technologies in use, legacy systems, new systems, domain knowledge. I am trying to help out others wherever I can and learning from others. As I always believe, learning is the way forward and one can never learn everything. I try to be humble, explain others what I know and do not hesitate to learn what I don't.

It is okay to make mistakes but it is important to understand what was wrong and to rectify it and prevent it from happening again in future as well.

Something that I need to work upon is communicating more freely in person with others whether it be colleagues or otherwise. It's very important in the corporate world and I need to get better at it.

Apart from work, almost every weekend I go out to explore in the new city of Bangalore. I signed up for a tech meetup. There are many that keep happening in this "Silicon Valley of India". Hopefully I get better at my communication points there as well. Well that's the hope.

I lost some weight (which was completely involuntary) as compared to the previous entry on this page below. It is good and I intend to keep it that way.

### Life

I am trying to cope up with life right now. What lies ahead of me is perhaps one of the impactful
life-changing moments of all time. I will try to be my best and ease into the corporate life over the next
few months. The mere thought of being 21 yo and the realisation that I will soon have to be financially
independent is scary. I am trying to be optimistic and hopeful about the future.


I wish to give my best at the trainings and coursework that I will be going through.I also wish to
contribute to open source projects, help others around me and learn more about tech and life.


### Health
I will not lie here, I have not been taking care of my health as well as I should. I have been inconsistent
with my dietary plans and often find myself indulging in junk food more than often. I try to maintain my
weight and see some reduction but after a while I find it on the rise again.


This has to change.I risk developing lifestyle diseases if I continue on this path and the situation can
worsen. I am trying to take care over the past few days and be conscious about what I consume.

### Reading and Learning
I&apos;ve been trying to read more technical books and articles. I can somewhat keep up with articles as
they are fairly short but I think I have decreased my focus span for books.

Currently I want to learn more about system design and architecture.Of course the famous book is{ " " }
<span className="italic">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</span> by Martin Kleppmann. However I am
trying to ease into the topics with Mikito Takada's [Distributed Systems for fun and profit](https://book.mixu.net/distsys/).

I keep [my notes in Obsidian](/posts/converting-vault-to-pdf) and occasionally write blog posts on what I learn.

I am also learning Go and trying to fit it into my usecases rather than reaching for Javascript all the time.

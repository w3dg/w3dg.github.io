## Finally the decision was made to move to freedom

After much sitting with my thoughts, I finally came to the conclusion to go full linux on my machine.

Don't get me wrong, I am fortunate enough to be  equipped with a decent machine. It has **16Gigs** of RAM, a **fairly good** (Intel I7 11th gen) CPU and overall its a very big upgrade from my old machine which is still at my home.

But here we are! I finally did the deed.

This isn't the first time I have installed it on bare metal though. The home pc which I had, I installed Xubuntu (XFCE version of Ubuntu) on it and it was working fantastically. It was a old machine but not potato. Linux gave new life to that machine.

I noticed _one_ of my professors during this semester at my university that he had ditched Windows completely! And gone full linux on his laptop. Many seniors I see also have done the same. So it felt like a right time to actually go into Linux. Already I was using some WSL2, Git Bash and other hacks to get Linux like feeling on windows but I finally left all that baggage behind and sat in one sitting from the afternoon and installed Ubuntu 24.04.

## The process

Everything was pretty smooth. There was one speed breaker in the beginning though. **BitLocker from Windows**.

Ha! I had totally forgot about Bitlocker and disabling it and decrypting it took over an hour! Well I carried on anyways.
 
I made a list of software I wanted to get which I used daily and mostly these were available for all sstems. I managed to get up and running and getting familiar and setup with most of my things by the evening.

The list can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/w3dg/7896f7a69ce250b706a29b1ac495664a) for my future reference and maybe even yours. I have also taken the base version of [my dotfiles](https://github.com/w3dg/dotfiles)  and then tweaked it to match Ubuntu's as I dont see myself going back to Windows anytime soon.

## Thoughts after the process

The entire process was very easy actually. Just you need some time and good internet. Most software, as I said, were already cross platform available so I didn't have many hiccups. Except _Whatsapp_ and _Notion_ which I may have to use web clients for. ( Or even look into FOSS alternatives :p).

Some notable mentions are [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq) - this helps to keep your cpu speed according to your battery life and actually have a good battery life. I have this running and can easily go about 5-6 hours which I got before as well while on Windows. In addition, [thermald](https://wiki.debian.org/thermald) is also mentioned on the internet.

## Impact on workflow

I believe its actually **an upgrade**! Everything is so snappy and everything is so easy and with a Desktop Environment like GNOME, where you have everything setup (of course there are others, and I said that I have Xubuntu running on another machine), it is just flawless. I'm actually looking forward to using it more and more.

I think thats all for now! Maybe I'll post more dev and updates about my FOSS journey here as well!
